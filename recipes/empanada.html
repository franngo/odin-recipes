        <h2><ins>Ingredients=</ins></h2>
        <h3>*&lpar;for a dozen of empanadas&rpar;</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 empanada covers</li>
            <li>1/2 kg. minced meat</li>
            <li>2 onions</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 tomato</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. tomato puree</li>
            <li>1 handful of olives</li>
            <li>Peppers</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><ins>Steps to follow=</ins></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot with hot oil, add the onion and bell pepper. Let it brown for a few minutes
            and when they are half cooked &lpar;transparent onion&rpar;, add the garlic and a little 
            salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat and add all the minced meat at once. Move the meat so that it does
            not stick. When the meat is sealed, add the diced tomato and 2 tablespoons of tomato
            puree. Season with paprika and cumin, a little more salt and pepper and mix well. Cover
            &lpar;not completely, leave a small space&rpar; and let cook for half an hour, stirring 
            little by little.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let cool in the pot. Add the chopped olives and mix well. 
            &lpar;In this step you can add anything else you want to add: hard-boiled egg, raisins, potato, 
            etc&rpar;.</li>
            <li>Distribute the filling among the empanada covers, and close with a traditional repulgue. 
            Before putting them in the oven you can paint them with egg, but it is very comfortable and 
            optional.</li>
            <li>Put our meat empanadas on a plate and bake at high temperature until they get golden brown. 
            Now it's time to enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

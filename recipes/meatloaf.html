        <h2><ins>Steps to follow=</ins></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook onion and garlic until onion is
            soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Combine onion and garlic mixture, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour 
            cream, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 can tomato sauce in a large bowl. Mix until well 
            combined. Gradually stir in milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until mixture is moist, but not 
            soggy.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to a 5x9-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 
            degrees F (200 degrees C). Continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 
            degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup in a small bowl. Pour over the top of the 
            meatloaf, and continue baking for 10 minutes. Now it's ready to serve. Time to enjoy!</li>
